<h1>Hello, all!</h1>

<p>This is a repository created for the sole purpose of note-taking and examples as I follow along with Brad Traversy in the Udemy course "Angular 4 Front to Back". As I am very interested in the MEAN stack, I really wanted some in depth coverage of some of the finer parts of angular, so I figured my GitHub page would be a good place to keep notes on this content and also have reference for some of the things that I learn.</p>

<p>For other things I've done similar to this, check out the following repos:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ThomasjNix/WebDevBootcamp">Web Dev Bootcamp</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ThomasjNix/WebDevBootcamp-Backend">Web Dev Bootcamp (Backend)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To keep track of my live portfolio project as I learn more about MEAN stack and build a good looking, functional, responsive SPA portfolio, check <a href="https://github.com/ThomasjNix/portfolio-live">here</a>! (Note: Previous or later versions may or may not include what you see here, this project is updated frequently with new material, and may be subject to vast changes while in development).</p>

<h3>Happy Coding!</h3>
